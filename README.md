Flashlight
==========

A pluggable integration with ElasticSearch to provide contextual searches in Firebase.

This script can:
 - monitor multiple Firebase paths and index data in real time
 - communicates with client completely via Firebase (client pushes search terms to `search/request` and reads results from `search/result`)
 - clean up old, outdated requests

Getting Started
===============

 - Install and run [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html) or add [Bonsai service](https://addons.heroku.com/bonsai#starter) via Heroku
 - `git clone https://github.com/firebase/flashlight`
 - `npm install`
 - edit config.js (see comments)
 - `node app.js` (run the app)

Check out the recommended security rules in example/seed/security_rules.json.
